# URL Shortener Python Project Web Application. 


The URL shortener is a Python project that converts long URLs into shorter, more manageable links. It takes a long URL as input, generates a unique shortened URL, and redirects users to the original URL when the shortened link is accessed.

## Scope

The scope of this project involves designing a user interface to input long URLs and display the shortened links, implementing a database to store the mapping between original and shortened URLs, and developing functions to generate unique shortened URLs and handle redirection.

## Installation

To use the File Organizer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Abhishek250055/URL_Shortener_Python_Project_Web_App`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd file-organizer`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Social Media Sharing: When sharing links on platforms like Twitter, where character limits are imposed, long URLs can be inconvenient. The URL shortener allows you to generate a shortened URL that can be easily shared within the character limit.

2. Marketing Campaigns: In marketing campaigns, you may have long and complex URLs for tracking purposes or to include UTM parameters. Using a URL shortener can make these URLs more visually appealing and easier to remember for users.

3. Website Analytics: When analyzing website traffic and referral sources, using short URLs can help track the effectiveness of specific campaigns, channels, or advertisements. You can generate unique short URLs for each campaign and monitor the click-through rates and conversions associated with them.

4. Email Marketing: In email campaigns, long URLs can break or wrap incorrectly in some email clients. By using a URL shortener, you can ensure that your links remain intact and clickable in all email clients, improving the user experience.

5. QR Codes: When generating QR codes for offline marketing materials like flyers or posters, long URLs can result in complex codes that are difficult to scan. Using a URL shortener, you can create shorter and more scannable QR codes, making it easier for users to access your content.
